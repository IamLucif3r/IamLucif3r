<h3 align="center">Platform Security Engineer & Researcher | Cloud-Native Security | Runtime Protection & eBPF Researcher</h3>

---

I am a Platform Security Engineer with a strong focus on securing cloud-native systems and modern distributed infrastructure. My work combines security engineering, systems programming, and automated security workflows to strengthen platform reliability and resilience.

My expertise spans runtime security, Linux kernel instrumentation with eBPF, container isolation strategies, dependency and supply-chain vulnerability analysis, and the design of developer-centric security automation. I specialize in building efficient, scalable solutions that provide visibility, detection, and protection across containerized workloads and multi-tenant environments.

I take a methodical approach to understanding how systems fail, how attackers exploit weaknesses, and how platforms can be engineered to withstand real-world threats.
